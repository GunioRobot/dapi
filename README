== Dapi ==

Dapi (django-api) is a RESTful API based on the same principles that made
the Django Admin so successful

It is still in the conception stage, here are some of the planned features:

 * Class based, apps have classes per model (ala Admin)
 * It would follow much of the same convention the admin takes
 * A user can multiple apis per say which a single api can have its own
 authentication method for support for both http basic/digest, oauth for example
 * Will support both 1.0.X and will at least consider the new url routing features in 1.1
